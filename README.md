#### Features Left to Implement

### Technology Used
 - Django : A python web framework
   - Django provides easy implementation of MVC pattern. Which serves our purpose very well
 - Heroku : A platform to host web application 
   - Heroku is a software as a service which made deployment very efficient and easy. It is also able to scale the web app
 -  Frontend : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery
    - All of this mandatory frontend technologies are used for simplify browser dom manipulation.  And styling the whole project.

### Testing 
**stripe**  is tested using `4242 4242 4242 4242` and a US zip code `99501` as its verified by US

 - Testing stripe with mentioned card number leaves with a error for the zip code. Which fix was not easy to find. 

**Forms** are tested by manual inputs
**Product**  CRUD are tested manually form admin panel

### Deployment
Deployment is entirely done with heroku. Difference between development and Deployment version is mentioned below

Deployment
 - Have proc file 
 - DEBUG: False 
 - Database: SQLite3 
 - Static files served from local

Development
 - Dont Have proc file 
 - DEBUG: True 
 - Database: PostgreSQL 
 - Static files served from whitenoise (a python library) storage

 # Limitation Issue (folder name Proof of DjangoEshop apps)
 SQLLite and AWS will keep reActivate the server and data will keep reactivated
Recorded Proof of video & images attached, shown I test all process and it worked well from login, click product to purchase and also shown the Stripe payment successed too.
